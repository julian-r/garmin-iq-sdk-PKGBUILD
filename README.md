Arch Linux PKGBUILD for Garmin IQ Connect SDK
---------------------------------------------

Lets you run the [Garmin IQ Connect
SDK](http://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/sdk/) in wine. Credits to
[http://aaronboman.com/](http://aaronboman.com/), he explains everything really
nicely on this
[blog entry](http://blog.aaronboman.com/programming/connectiq/2014/11/13/the-garmin-connect-iq-sdk-on-ubuntu-linux/).

I reproduced what he wrote with the exception that i did not create a starter
script for the simulator, instead I used the existing script called
`connectiq`.
